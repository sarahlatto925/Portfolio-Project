                    <h1>Sarah's Favorite Artists</h1>
                    <p>Listening to music is one of my favorite things. Whether it be walking to class, driving in the car with my friends, or even just getting ready to go out in my room, I always have something playing! Here's a list of some of my favorite artists at the moment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class = "frank-ocean txt-block item">
                    <h2>Frank Ocean</h2>
                    <p>Frank Ocean has been one of my favorite artists since his album, Blonde, was released in 2016. I have listened to this album almost a hundred times. After listening to this album, I started listening to some of his other music, such as his first studio album Channel Orange. Although Frank rarely does interviews, and is rarely in the public eye, I still love listening to his music and am a huge fan. </p>

                <div class = 'billie-eilish txt-block item'>
                    <h2>Billie Eilish</h2>
                    <p>Billie Eilish is also one of my favorite artists. She is super talented and even younger than me! I love listening to her music and think she is very inspirational and cool.</p>

                <div class = 'mac-miller txt-block item'>
                    <h2>Mac Miller</h2>
                    <p>Not only do I love listening to Mac Miller's music, but he has always been one of my favorite artists. His music has gotten me through some hard times, and I wish he was still around. </p>
                </div>

                <div class = 'j-cole txt-block item'>
                    <h2>J Cole</h2>
                    <p>J Cole was probably the first artist I listened to when I started listening to rap. I love listening to his music because his lyrics are so powerful and he has such a unique voice.</p>
